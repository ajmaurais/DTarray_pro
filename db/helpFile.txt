NAME
	DTarray_AJM 


USAGE: DTarray    [-i, —-in <mode>]
[-o, —-out <format>]
[-u, —-unique]
[-d, —-directory <directory>]
[-r, —-recompile]
[-p, —-prefix <prefix>]
[-rw <arg>]
[-par <file>]
[-k, —-keepParams]
[-loc]
[-mw <fasfa file>]

DESCRIPTION
	DTarray_AJM extracts Uniprot ID numbers, molecular weights, and spectral
	counts from .dtafilter files stored in the working directory. Data

OPTIONS
	
	-h, —-help
		Display this help file.

	-i, —-in <mode>
		Specify which input mode is used.

		standard	Read in DTASelect-filter files stored in a 
				common directory with the name 
				<sample name>.dtafilter

		subidr		Read in DTASelect-filter files stored in 
				subdirrectories where the sample name is the
				dirrectory name and the filter file is named
				DTASelect-filter.txt. In subdir mode, DTarray 
				will search all dirrectories one level below
				working	directory for valid DTASelect-filter 
				files.

	-o, —-out <format>
		Specify format of output file.

		standard	Use standard output format.

		db		Use long output format.

	-u, —-unique
		Include spectral counts for unique peptides in results file.

	-d, —-directory <file>
		Specify parent directory from which to run program. Otherwise, 
		current working directory is used.

	-r, —-recompile
		Recompile all c++ source code before running DTarray.
		g++ must be installed to use this option.

	-p <prefix>
		Remove <prefix> from all sample names. If <prefix> is not 
		found, the sample name is unchanged. In db output format, 
		columns will be included for long sample name, short sample
		name and replicate number. The value for replicate number is 
		taken as: <number> where the sample name is in the format 
		<sample name>_<number>.

	-rw <arg>
		Rewrite existing param files in working directory.

		flist		Rewrite input file list.

		smod 		Rewrite static modifications file.
	
	-par <file>
		Specify params file. By default, dtarray_ajm.params is used.
	
	-k, —-keepParams
		Do not overwrite params file.

	-loc
		Use subCelluarLoc.txt in $PROGRAM_DIR/db/ to included subcelluar
		localization information in results file.

	-mw <fasfa file>
		Use amino acid masses in $PROGRAM_DIR/db/aaMasses.txt, static 
		modifications in staticModifications.txt file in working 
		directory, and sequence information in <fasfa file> to calculate
 		peptide or protein masses taking into account specified static
		modifications. Sequence information in <fasfa file> must be
		supplied by the user. A staticModifications.txt file will be
		generated by DTarray in the working directory and can then be 
		edited by the user.

EXAMPLES
	DTarray
		Run DTarray using default parameters.
	
	DTarray -i subdir
		Run DTarray in working directory reading DTASelect-filter files
		in subdir format.

	DTarray -mw <file>
		Combine filter files with DTarray then use static modifications
		file and sequence file to calculate the molecular weights of
		proteins in dataset.
